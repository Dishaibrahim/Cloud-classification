# Cloud Classification Model

## Overview

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying cloud types, including Nimbus, Cirrus, etc. The model is trained using image data augmented with various transformations like rotation, shifting, and flipping to improve robustness.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model can be found [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CADDPD). It includes images of different cloud types organized in folders by cloud type.

## Requirements

- `numpy`: NumPy is used for numerical computations and array manipulation.
- `opencv-python`: OpenCV is used for image processing tasks such as reading, resizing, and manipulating images.
- `matplotlib`: Matplotlib is used for plotting and visualizing data, including images and model performance metrics.
- `scikit-learn`: Scikit-learn is used for data preprocessing and splitting, as well as for evaluating the model's performance.
- `keras`: Keras is used to build, train, and evaluate the convolutional neural network model.
  
You can install these dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Files

- **cloud_classification_model.py**: Contains the code for training the CNN model and preprocessing image data.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the dependencies required to run the code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloud-classification.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have downloaded the dataset and organized it in folders by cloud type.
2. Modify the `cloud_classification_model.py` file as needed (e.g., adjust model architecture, hyperparameters).
3. Run the script to train the model:
   ```bash
   python cloud_classification_model.py
   ```

## Functionality

- **Model Compilation**: The model is compiled using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
- **Data Augmentation**: Image data is augmented using transformations like rotation, shifting, and flipping to increase the diversity of training data.
- **Training**: The model is trained on the augmented data with early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks to prevent overfitting.
